##Demo Branch
Check out the demo [here](azaslavsky.github.io/backbone-hashMate/demo).  Note that it is a single page app, and if you want to test other entry points (ex: `azaslavsky.github.io/backbone-hashMate/demo/options`), you'll have to download the master and install it locally.  For more info, [check out these instructions](https://github.com/azaslavsky/backbone-hashMate/tree/master#demo).
